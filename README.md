# Mysf

Mysf is a Library based on the SFML, its goal is to easly create 2D games. To do so, mysf provides 2D games base code you would have to think of, so you don't have to recode all-over again what you would do otherwise.

### Prerequisites

The library is based on the SFML so you will need to install the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) first.

### Installing

Download the project and compile it with the makefile. It will generates .a and .so libraries.

### Running the tests

There's an example directory that contains a project wich you can run to test if the library works.
